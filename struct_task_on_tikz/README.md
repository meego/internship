## How to write for tikz

See [here](http://math.et.info.free.fr/TikZ/bdd/TikZ-Impatient.pdf) and
[here](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf) (there is two manuals). The first one is in
french. It's very long, but also very powerfull.

## How to use tikz

I fully recommand to install the **texlive-full** package, on
Debian/Ubuntu/FreeBSD. If you are an Arch Linux user, you could install
**texlive-most**. You need another package, which is not by default in some
Latex installation: the **forest** package. You can download this package
[here](http://ctan.org/pkg/forest).

#### Note

 If you're on *Debian stable*, you need to manually install the last version
 of **pgf** package.
