# sesi_report

## What is this

This is my second report for my internship. Why ? Because I'm in the SAR master,
but the ALSOC team is attached to the SESI master. I choose to follow the rules
of both departments, that's why I've two reports: one for each deparment.

## Misc

This ugly template is mandatory..
